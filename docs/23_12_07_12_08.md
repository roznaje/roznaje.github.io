Here is a proof of Minkowski's theorem, which states that every finitely 
constrained cone is finitely generated. This theorem reverses 
[Weyl's theorem](23_12_07_11_50.md). Let us start with a useful definition and
lemma. 

<div class="block-head">Definition</div>
<div class="block-body">
The <em>dual cone</em> $C^{*}$ of a cone $C\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is 
defined as

\[
C^{*}\stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\{y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\colon y^{\top}x\leq 0\;
\text{for all}\; x\in C\}.
\]
</div>

It is easy to see that, if $C=\{B\lambda\colon \lambda\geq0\}$, then 
$C^{*}=\{y\colon B^{\top}y\leq 0\}$. 

<div class="block-head">Lemma</div>
<div class="block-body">
If $C$ is a closed cone, then $C^{**}=C$. 
</div>

$\rhd$ We obviously have $C\subset C^{**}$. Suppose that there exists 
$z\in C^{**}\setminus C$. Since $C$ is closed it follows that there is a nonzero
vector $a\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that 
$a^{\top}x\leq 0< a^{\top}z$ for all $x\in C$. Therefore, 
$a\in C^{*}$ and $z\not\in C^{**}$. This is a contradiction. $\lhd$


Let $C=\{x\colon Ax\leq 0\}=\{A^{\top}\lambda\colon \lambda >0\}^{*}$. 
From the above lemma, it follows that 
$C^{*}=\{A^{\top}\lambda\colon\lambda \geq 0\}$.


<div class="block-head">Minkowski's theorem</div>
<div class="block-body">
A finitely constrained cone is finitely generated.
</div>

$\rhd$ Let $C=\{x\colon Ax\leq 0\}$. Then 
$C^{*}=\{A^{\top}\lambda\colon\lambda\geq 0\}$. From Weyl's theorem it follows 
that $C^{*}=\{y\colon By\leq 0\}$. Since $C$ is a closed cone, 
it follows that

\[
C=C^{**}=\{B^{\top}\lambda\colon\lambda\geq0\}.\quad \lhd
