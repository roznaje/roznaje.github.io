Here is a proof of Weyl's theorem, which states that every finitely generated 
cone is finitely constrained. Let us star with definitions.

<div class="block-head">Definition</div>
<div class="block-body">
A <em>cone</em> is a set $C\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that for all vectors 
$x$, $y\in C$ and non-negative numbers $\lambda$, $\mu\geq 0$ we have 
$\lambda x+\mu y\in C$.
</div>

<div class="block-head">Definition</div>
<div class="block-body">
A <em>finitely constrained cone</em> $C$ is the intersection of finitely many 
closed linear half-spaces, i.e. $C=\{x\colon Ax\leq 0\}$ for 
some real $m\times n$-matrix $A$.
</div>

<div class="block-head">Definition</div>
<div class="block-body">
A <em>finitely generated cone</em> $C$ is a set of all linear combinations of  
finitely many vectors $b_{1}$, $b_{2}$, $\ldots$, $b_{k}$ with 
non-negative coefficients, i.e. 

\[
\begin{array}{c}
C=\mathrm{cone}\,(b_{1},b_{2},\ldots,b_{k})=\\
=\left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}
\lambda_{i}b_{i}\colon\lambda_{i}\geq 0\right\}=\{B\lambda\colon\lambda\geq 0\}.
\end{array}
\]
</div>

<div class="block-head">Weyl's theorem</div>
<div class="block-body">
A finitely generated cone is finitely constrained.
</div>

$\rhd$ Let $C=\{B\lambda\colon\lambda\geq 0\}$. A vector $x$ belongs to 
$C$ if and only if $x$ is the part of a solution of the following system

\[
\begin{cases}
x-B\lambda\leq 0,\\
-x+B\lambda\leq 0,\\
-\lambda\leq 0.
\end{cases}\tag{1}
\]

Using [Fourier-Motzkin elimination](23_11_30_18_37.md) to eliminate variables 
$\lambda_{1}$, $\lambda_{2}$, $\ldots$, $\lambda_{m}$ from system (1), 
we obtain a new system of inequalities $Ax\leq 0$ that defines $C$. $\lhd$

<div class="block-head">Corollary</div>
<div class="block-body">
A finitely generated cone is closed.
</div>

$\rhd$ Since the intersection of closed half-spaces is closed, it follows
that every finitely constrained cone is closed. Finallym, Weyl's theorem 
implies that every finitely generated cone is closed. $\lhd$
