Let $S$ be the inscribed sphere of a polyhedron $P$. We call a face of $P$ large 
if the projection of $S$ onto the plane of the face is entirely inside the face. 
Prove that there are no more than $6$ large faces.

$\rhd$ By $R$ we denote the radius of $S$. For each large face we consider a 
part of $S$, located in a cone, the vertex of which is the center of $S$, and 
the base is the projection of $S$ onto this face. Each such part is a 
spherical cap of height $h=(1-\sqrt{2}/2)R$. Therefore, the area of each part is
equal to $2\pi hR=\pi (2-\sqrt{2}) R^{2}$. Let $n$ be the number of large faces.
We have $n\pi (2-\sqrt{2}) R^{2}\leq 4\pi R^{2}$, so 
$n\leq\dfrac{4}{(2-\sqrt{2})}<7$. Therefore, there are no more than $6$ large 
faces. $\lhd$
